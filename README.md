# VoxelEngine
starting with basics of voxels and ill see how far I get

Current status:

Draws voxel chunks (10x10x10 voxels) that are attached to a voxelmap but they have to be manually added for the moment.

Currently a graphical bug with shape boundaries.

Voxel chunk can be constructed with function pointer to define what it looks like.
